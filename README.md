This is designed to help assist in voicing cards in the game Legend of Runeterra.

Project is a submission for the 2019 Riot Client API competition.

- Electron 6.1
- iohook 0.6.1

**Clone and run for a quick way to see Electron in action.**

This is a minimal Electron application based on the [Quick Start Guide](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start) within the Electron documentation.

## To Use

To clone and run this repository you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/DR-duo/vor-desktop
# Go into the repository
cd vor-desktop
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Run the app
npm start
```

Note: iohook 0.6.1 will cause errors during install. Two solutions that have been encountered were to have Python 2 and MSBuild.exe version 15 (VS 2017) installed. These are temporary work arounds until iohook releases an improved version.
